## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Best-effort database-name replay: the notebook's stored
  `currentDatabase` is applied with `USE` after the transaction starts,
  and a cell's stored `useDatabase` is applied before that cell runs.
  When the name does not match an attached catalog, the export warns
  and continues with the current database
  ([#7](https://github.com/b-trout/duckdb-nb-export/issues/7)).

## [0.0.1] - 2026-07-05

Initial alpha release.

### Added

- CLI export of DuckDB UI notebooks to a standalone HTML file by
  re-executing notebook cells against a target database, inside a single
  transaction that finishes with `ROLLBACK` by default.
- A snapshot-copy reader that can read `ui.db` while DuckDB UI is still
  running.
- A safety model covering output path confinement, `CREATE SECRET`
  parameter masking, an execution confirmation prompt, and
  `--no-external-access` to disable DuckDB external access.
- `--notebook-id` to disambiguate notebooks that share a name.
- `--list` and `--list-versions` to list notebooks and notebook versions.
- Single-file HTML rendering with inline CSS supporting light and dark
  color schemes.

### Known limitations

- No chart rendering, no notebook environment (database) replay, and no
  verified Windows support.
