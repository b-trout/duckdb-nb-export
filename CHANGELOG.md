## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.1] - 2026-07-05

Initial alpha release.

### Added

- CLI export of DuckDB UI notebooks to a standalone HTML file by
  re-executing notebook cells against a target database, inside a single
  transaction that finishes with `ROLLBACK` by default.
- A snapshot-copy reader that can read `ui.db` while DuckDB UI is still
  running.
- A safety model covering output path confinement, `CREATE SECRET`
  parameter masking, an execution confirmation prompt, and
  `--no-external-access` to disable DuckDB external access.
- `--notebook-id` to disambiguate notebooks that share a name.
- `--list` and `--list-versions` to list notebooks and notebook versions.
- Single-file HTML rendering with inline CSS supporting light and dark
  color schemes.

### Known limitations

- No chart rendering, no notebook environment (database) replay, and no
  verified Windows support.
